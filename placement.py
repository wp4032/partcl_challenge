"""
VLSI Cell Placement Optimization Challenge
==========================================

CHALLENGE OVERVIEW:
You are tasked with implementing a critical component of a chip placement optimizer.
Given a set of cells (circuit components) with fixed sizes and connectivity requirements,
you need to find positions for these cells that:
1. Minimize total wirelength (wiring cost between connected pins)
2. Eliminate all overlaps between cells

YOUR TASK:
Implement the `overlap_repulsion_loss()` function to prevent cells from overlapping.
The function must:
- Be differentiable (uses PyTorch operations for gradient descent)
- Detect when cells overlap in 2D space
- Apply increasing penalties for larger overlaps
- Work efficiently with vectorized operations

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
After running the optimizer with your implementation:
- overlap_count should be 0 (no overlapping cell pairs)
- total_overlap_area should be 0.0 (no overlap)
- wirelength should be minimized
- Visualization should show clean, non-overlapping placement

GETTING STARTED:
1. Read through the existing code to understand the data structures
2. Look at wirelength_attraction_loss() as a reference implementation
3. Implement overlap_repulsion_loss() following the TODO instructions
4. Run main() and check the overlap metrics in the output
5. Tune hyperparameters (lambda_overlap, lambda_wirelength) if needed
6. Generate visualization to verify your solution

BONUS CHALLENGES:
- Improve convergence speed by tuning learning rate or adding momentum
- Implement better initial placement strategy
- Add visualization of optimization progress over time

    TODO: IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION

    This is the main challenge. You need to implement a differentiable loss function
    that penalizes overlapping cells. The loss should:

    1. Be zero when no cells overlap
    2. Increase as overlap area increases
    3. Use only differentiable PyTorch operations (no if statements on tensors)
    4. Work efficiently with vectorized operations

    HINTS:
    - Two axis-aligned rectangles overlap if they overlap in BOTH x and y dimensions
    - For rectangles centered at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) with widths (w1, w2) and heights (h1, h2):
      * x-overlap occurs when |x1 - x2| < (w1 + w2) / 2
      * y-overlap occurs when |y1 - y2| < (h1 + h2) / 2
    - Use torch.relu() to compute positive overlaps: overlap_x = relu((w1+w2)/2 - |x1-x2|)
    - Overlap area = overlap_x * overlap_y
    - Consider all pairs of cells: use broadcasting with unsqueeze
    - Use torch.triu() to avoid counting each pair twice (only consider i < j)
    - Normalize the loss appropriately (by number of pairs or total area)

    RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
    1. Extract positions, widths, heights from cell_features
    2. Compute all pairwise distances using broadcasting:
       positions_i = positions.unsqueeze(1)  # [N, 1, 2]
       positions_j = positions.unsqueeze(0)  # [1, N, 2]
       distances = positions_i - positions_j  # [N, N, 2]
    3. Calculate minimum separation distances for each pair
    4. Use relu to get positive overlap amounts
    5. Multiply overlaps in x and y to get overlap areas
    6. Mask to only consider upper triangle (i < j)
    7. Sum and normalize

    Args:
        cell_features: [N, 6] tensor with [area, num_pins, x, y, width, height]
